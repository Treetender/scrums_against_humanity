# Scrums Against Humanity
A snarky and wacky take on agile planning.  Why the name? I love the game <i>Cards Against Humanity</i>, and I wanted to pay homage to it.

This little app holds decks of planning cards dev teams can use when estimating their work in an agile workflow.  I found lots of our meeting rooms had these little paper decks, but I don't like wasting paper. Plus, I really wanted to try out flutter and have some fun!

## Plaforms
Flutter is very versitile, so this application will run on iOS, Android, and the web.

## Web Version on Git Pages
If you are daring, you can check out the web version (built from master) on git pages:

https://treetender.github.io/scrums_against_humanity/

You can also install it as a Progressive Web App

## Getting Started
As a flutter app, it's pretty simple to set this up.

1. Clone the repo or download a zip of the project folder
1. Go to the project folder root
1. Run `flutter run` and watch the fun.

If you want to contribute, please do! But, please raise pull requests. I also highly encourage forking the repo if you want to get into development.
